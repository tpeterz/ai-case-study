## Business Activities

* Specifically, Vectra aims to solve the issue of cybersecurity attacks. They intend to protect against cyberattacks by providing technology that will detect and respond when a business' security becomes threatened. They analyze the behavior of various attackers to help them identify threats and patterns of that behavior.

* Customers that can use Vectra span across all different categories. Retail companies, such as Under Armour, Manufacturing, such as Lamb Weston, and technology groups, like True Digital Group, have already used Vectra's technology of attack signals to protect their companies. This is absolutely a company whose intended customer would be any company looking to better equip themselves with cybersecurity technology.

* A major advantage that Vectra AI has over it's competitors is their alert system. Other companies may overwhelm and "flood" their customers with a significant amount of alerts, with most of them being useless. They use their AI and Machine learning technology to weed-out those insignificant signals of attacks, and only provide alerts when absolutely necessary and in a timely fashion. 

    "It's the difference between managing pointless detections and investigating and responding to real attacks. And it's the reason we have over 95% customer retention." (Vectra)

* Technologies: Vectra calls it "Attack Signal Intelligence," which prioritizes attacks over other events that could pose no actual threat. They use "machine learning to detect patterns, distinguish the malicious from the benign and reduce more than 80% of alert noise." (Vectra, Products) This technology thinks like an attacker, prioritizes and identifies where blind spots may be (Vectra, Attack Signal Intelligence).
